# Theme Combo

Two simple commands to save and load combinations of UI Theme and Color scheme.

# Installation

Clone the repository into your Sublime `Packages` folder, or use
[Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io).

# Usage

Open the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P` by default) and search for *Theme Combo*.
Two commands are avaible:

- **Save current combo** will save the Theme and Color scheme that you are currently
  using. Give it a name and it will be stored in your preferences.
- **Load combo** will let you choose one of your saved combos and apply both Theme and
  Color scheme instantly.
